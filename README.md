# Guitar Resources

Those are resources that have helped me, my friends or students in learning and practicing guitar and music. I'm not affiliated with any of them, those are just things I like or hope are useful. While I tried to limit it to free resources, the list contains some things that are not.

## YouTube Channels

### Good for Beginners

Other channels that I like, more advanced and not necessarily guitar focused, but great content nonetheless

## Websites

### Metronomes

* [Metronome - Google Search](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=metronome)
    * Search for "metronome" on Google and you get a basic one in your browser
* [Online metronome](https://www.musicca.com/metronome)
* [Online metronome](https://www.metronomeonline.com/)
* [Online metronome](https://www.imusic-school.com/en/tools/online-metronome/)

### Tuners

* [Guitar Tuner](https://www.fender.com/online-guitar-tuner/)
* [Online Guitar Tuner with Microphone](https://tuner-online.com/)

### Songs (Tabs and Chords)

Note that tabs and chords for songs on these sites are not always accurate. I find it best to learn by ear, with a teacher or a YouTube lesson if possible and then check against what I find on these websites. That said, they can be very useful.

* [Ultimate Guitar Tabs](https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/)
* [A-Z Guitar Tabs](https://www.guitaretab.com/)
* [Songsterr](https://www.songsterr.com/)
* [Chordie](https://www.chordie.com/browsesong.php)

## Desktop Software

### Notation and Tabs

* [MuseScore](https://musescore.org/en)
    * Free music composition and notation software
    * Also handles guitar tabs
    * Lots of features, but steep learning curve
* [Guitar Pro](https://www.guitar-pro.com/en/index.php)
    * Not free, around C$70
    * Tabs and notation editor
    * The standard for most online tabs
    * Expensive and not super stable, but it seems to be the most used software to write tabs and has lots of guitar-specific features that other notation apps lack, beginners definitely don't need it

### DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations)

* [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/)
    * Free, open source, cross-platform audio software for multi-track recording and editing
* [GarageBand for Mac](https://www.apple.com/mac/garageband/)
    * Apple's "entry level" DAW, but has lots of features
    * Free if you have a Mac, not available on Linux and Windows
* [Soundtrap](https://www.soundtrap.com/)
    * Online recording and editing software
    * Free with paid subscription for premium features
    * I've never used it so I don't know how it works or how good it is
* [Cakewalk](https://www.bandlab.com/products/cakewalk)
    * Windows only
    * I've never used it but it has a good reputation

## Phone and Tablet Apps

I don't have an Android phone or tablet so I only know about iOS apps but most of those should have Android versions. Not of all of those are free, some are free to download but have in-app purchases but I tried to find the cheapest ones. Those are just a few of the thousands of music apps on the App Store, search for similar terms and you're sure to find more!
